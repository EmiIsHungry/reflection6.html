    <p> When making my first vector emotive eye, I was nervous because I wanted it to be perfect,and I wanted to show emotion. It didn’t help much after I finished making it because I wanted to put more things into it but I couldn’t. I really like making it though. The challenges I faced while making it had to be making the lines and emotions fit the right place. It’s harder to make it with a mouse and it’s harder to convey your feelings into it since you need to make it have an emotion. I never looked very deep into emotion until now which is a nice experience. It makes you question, I feel these emotions before but I never looked at it and be like that’s how it should look like.</p>

    <p>  I learned Illustrator can cut shapes out even on top of another shape and layerings are very important when you trying to fix that one part. I also learned that it’s hard to show emotion in art since you have lot of imagination for it but you’re trying to decide which is the best one to do. Which is hard and you should just do it. You will never will feel satisfied until you do it. I hope to gain from this course is an understanding of color, emotion and photoshop. Since I want to make a game that connects people by the feelings and imagery so this would be the best thing I could gain from this course. </p>
